1. we used the same code section of validity check in all of the programs.
we could have narrow it down by writing this code in the bash script once instead of writing it in each program, or instead writing this code sucction in a function that is saved in a library and the other function can call to.

2. A continuous uniform distribution is a  distribution where every value within a specified interval has an equal probability of occurring. In other words, it is a probability distribution where the probability density function is constant over the entire range of possible values.
after running on random grades, we observed that the grades are not in a continuous uniform distribution.
 when running the hist program with the grades we get each time
 from the command, the grades are not evenly divided between the bins,
especially when taking small number of grades.
when we're taking a bigger number of grades, the distribution is getting more even.
